## Bugs

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| The game would not work due to extra blank spaces in line 14 of run.py | Remove extra blank space |
| The game would not detect a winner of the game | Fix line 98 so it returns an even number (% 2 ==0) |
| Class Players would not allow the functions within to be used in the run.py file | Change the class name to Contestants |
| Game wouldnt print when a player had made a selections | Add an f(string) on line 190 of run.py |

## Deployment

The website was deployed using Heroku by following these steps (taken from Code Institute):
1. Use the "pip freeze -> requiremnts.txt" command in the terminal to save any libraries that need to be instaled in the file as instructed by Code Institute.
2. Login or create a Heroku account
3. Click the "new" button in the upper right corner and select "create new app"
4. Choose an app name and your region and click "Create app"
5. Go to the "settings" tab, add the python build pack and then the node.js build pack
6. Go to the "deploy" tab and pick GitHub as a deployment method
7. Search for a repository to connect to
8. Click enable automatic deploys and then deploy branch
9. Wait for the app to build and then click on the "View" link

You can fork the repository by following these steps:
1. Go to the GitHub repository
2. Click on the Fork button in the upper right-hand corner

## Future Considerations

I would have liked time to work on this and develop the game further. Some improvements i would make in the future are below:
1. I would have a separate file for the welcome message to tidy the code up. This would also require User Input to confirm they want to play the game.
2. I would create a choice so that the user could decide to play the computer or another person.
3. I would add a loop at the end of the game so the user is offered to play again.

## Credits
- The idea to create this game came from my neice who asked me for a game when i was visiting home.
